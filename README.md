# Seesaw-Simulation

- This is a project written in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and it is created for visualizing a seesaw simulation where objects with random-weight are dropped by clicking directly on the seesaw.

- I will be building this project in stages, continuing stage by stage and committing every addition and change I made along the way. 
- I will be adding the additions I made to the project to the README.md file aswell.
